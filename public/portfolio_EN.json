      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jacco Veldscholten. I'm 23 Years old , living near Enschede. My Hobby is photography and building drones & learning new programming languages and methodes to implement en deploy software. Currently im studying at the Windesheim Bachlor Embedded Engineering. My main expertise is writing software for embedded systems like STM32, AVR, FPGA. But I often find it more fun to go a step further and make a complete product. As a result, I have immersed myself in several programming languages such as React, Flutter, PHP and some database systems. From my hobby and previous study (Electrial Engineer) I learned to develop printed circuit boards and electrical diagrams myself. This is a nice addition for developing a complete product. Have a look on my site and check out my previous projects ðŸ˜€ If you want to reach out to me send me an email to: jacco@veldscholten.tech",

After the fall it sends out a message to an contact that is been setupped inside an application. The application is written in Dart & Flutter. Communicating to an NodeJS REST API that stores all values in Firestore. The device it self is communicating with KPN LoRa Network to there is no future network required. The software on the device is written in Embedded C for STM32.",

In this project i used 2 IN-9 Tubes that are controlled by an Circuit board Designed in Eagle PCB Designer. By rotation its possible to display other views on the device like an Spectrum Analyzer, Clock, Timer or an Thermometer. The housing is drawn in Solidworks and processed by and CNC Milling machine. The code for the clock is written in C++ under PlatformIO",
